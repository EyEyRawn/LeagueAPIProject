                        <h2><u><b>What is this website?</u></b></h2>
                        <p>If you stumbled across this by accident, this is a project 
                            designed for a college course. Specifically, it's an API 
                            website that will look up the average stats of a League of Legends 
                            player's last 20 games and display them. An important thing to know
                            is that as of now, the website <b>only works in Google Chrome with CORS disabled</b>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>Why is the website so small?</u></b></h2>
                        <p>There's two main reasons for this. The first is that the website uses
                            a development API key, which severly limits the number of requests I 
                            can make for information. The second is that this is a big project for 
                            me, I made it by myself, and I've never done anything like this before!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>How does it work?</b></u></h2>
                        <p>There's two main features. First is the <a href=stats.html>profile page</a>, which lets you view 
                            the results of a single profile. Second is the <a href=versus.html>versus</a> page, which lets 
                            you look at two different profiles at the same time to compare their stats. 
                            See who's doing better, you or your friends! To use either though, you need 
                            to disable CORS in your browser.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>What is CORS, and how do I disable it?</u></b></h2>
                        <p>CORS is a browser security feature. While handy, it blocks API requests unless whitelisted. When 
                            using this website you'll need to disable it, as it uses a limited API key. There are extensions for popular 
                            browsers that support this. Try using <a href=https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf>this extension</a>
                            for Google Chrome. As a best practice, reenable CORS when 
                            you're done; it's not a one-stop-shop for safety, but it <i>is</i> one of many 
                            active security features in your browser to give you a safe experience on the 
                            web. Every bit of help counts!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>Why won't my stats show, I know I entered the right name!</u></b></h2>
                        <p>Assuming you've disabled CORS, this is because one of two reasons. Either your profile isn't on an 
                            American server, or you don't have a unique username (anything ending 
                            in #NA1). At the moment I only support American profiles that have a 
                            unique username. Profiles with a non-unique username (Randomdude#BARK) 
                            won't be found.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>Why does it take so long to show my stats?</u></b></h2>
                        <p>The information displayed is gathered from the Riot Games API so it may take 
                            a few seconds for the information to load. There's no database, so the 
                            information is gathered each time you submit a username. Please allow three 
                            to five seconds for the information to load.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>The website was working, but now it's not, what gives?</b></u></h2>
                        <p>The limited API key I have access to puts a limit on the number of requests.
                            At the moment it will allow you to search for or update a profile about four times
                            every two minutes. If you aren't making multiple requests, it's probably because I 
                            haven't updated the API key yet (it needs to be replaced with a new key given to me 
                            every 24 hours).
                        </p>
