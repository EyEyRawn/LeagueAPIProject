                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>What is this website?</u></b></h2>
                        <p>If you stumbled across this by accident, this is a project 
                            designed for a college course. Specifically, it's an API 
                            website that will look up the average stats of a League of Legends 
                            player's last 20 games and display them.<b>At this point the API 
                            key has expired so this website is no longer functional.</b></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>Why is the website so small?</u></b></h2>
                        <p>There's two main reasons for this. The first is that the website uses
                            a development API key, which severly limits the number of requests I 
                            can make for information. The second is that this is a big project for 
                            me, I made it by myself, and I've never done anything like this before!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>How does it work?</b></u></h2>
                        <p>There's two main features. First is the <a href=stats.html>profile page</a>, which lets you view 
                            the results of a single profile. Second is the <a href=versus.html>versus</a> page, which lets 
                            you look at two different profiles at the same time to compare their stats. 
                            See who's doing better, you or your friends!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>Why won't my stats show, I know I entered the right name!</u></b></h2>
                        <p>This is because one of two reasons. Either your profile isn't on an 
                            American server, or you don't have a unique username (anything ending 
                            in #NA1). At the moment I only support American profiles that have a 
                            unique username. Profiles with a non-unique username (Randomdude#BARK) 
                            won't be found.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>Why does it take so long to show my stats?</u></b></h2>
                        <p>The information displayed is gathered from the Riot Games API so it may take 
                            a few seconds for the information to load. There's no database, so the 
                            information is gathered each time you submit a username. Please allow three 
                            to five seconds for the information to load.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2><u><b>Can I see the code?</b></u></h2>
                        <p>Sure! The code for the website can be seen <a href=https://github.com/EyEyRawn/LeagueAPIProject/tree/main>here</a>.
